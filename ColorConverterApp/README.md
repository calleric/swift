## ColorConverterApp is a SwiftUI app used to show Color conversion


<BR>

HSB (Hue, Saturation, and Brightness) represents color in a more human-understandable
way, which closely mimics how colors are perceived in real life. Defining color using
HSB instead of RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) in App design can result in a more
intuitive design with the creation of harmonious color schemes and color gradients.
This article shows how to convert color to HSB and RGV values using UIColor.
