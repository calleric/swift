## PieChartApp is a SwiftUI app used to play around with Pie charts added to Swift Charts in iOS 17


<BR>

A pie chart is a circular graph that represents data as slices of a whole. Each
slice, or “wedge”, represents a portion or percentage of the whole data set. Pie
charts can be used to show the composition of a categorical data set, where each
category’s size is proportional to its percentage of the whole. This article shows
how to create a pie chart and a donut chart and how to customise the appearance of
these charts using swift charts.

In iOS 17 Apple has enhanced the charting capabilities of swift charts. This app
looks at the creation and customisation of Pie charts and donut charts in Swift
charts.
