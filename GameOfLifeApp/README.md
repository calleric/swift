## GameOfLifeApp is a SwiftUI app used to implement Conway's Game of Life


<BR>


Conway's [Game of Life][] was devised by John Conway in 1970. It is fascinating to
watch the different patterns evolve. It is an automatic (zero player) game consisting
of a 2D grid where cells are either alive or dead. The state of each cell in the next
iteration is based on the cells around it in the current iteration following the
following 4 rules:


>   1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
>   2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
>   3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
>   4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
