## LinearGradient is a SwiftUI app used to play around with linear gradients on Color


<BR>

LinearGradient is used to transition from one color to another in an object in
SwiftUI. It takes an array of colors and points for the start end of the transition.
The color smoothly transitions from the start in a linear manner in the direction of
the end along a straight line. There are some standard points set, but any
coordinates can be used between 0 and 1.

Using specific coordinates, the color pencil was updated with a color gradient set at
an angle across the tip of the pencil.
